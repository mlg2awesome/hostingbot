# Future Updates: 

## Music Module...
I'm going to try as hard as I can to make a music module for you guys, but it *will* be premium. Please be aware.

## Premium...
I'm going to get a premium *server* system setup, so you guys who wanna support me will be able to get some rewards other than just a crappy 'Superpatron' role.

## More Modulating, and fixes. 
The ban logger is constantly being worked on so you guys can have effecient ban tracking. As the bot gets bigger, I'm going to have to step up my game. **ALOT.** I know it takes a lot to keep whole discord servers satisfied, but I promise I will fit the challenge.

## Some more random crap.
Eh, more fun commands and stuff. I don't really have any good ideas for commands, so if you guys could suggest new features, it'd be great. Just create a new issue, or use the contact command... `h!contact [msg]`

# Welp, that's all for now.
Yeah, the header above was telling the truth. *puts away lie detector*
That's the end of this one. See you later people. *CHAO*
